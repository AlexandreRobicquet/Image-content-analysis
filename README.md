## LeNet

This tutorial introduces the LeNet5 neural network architecture
using Theano.  LeNet5 is a convolutional neural network, good for
classifying images. This tutorial shows how to build the architecture,
and comes with all the hyper-parameters you need to reproduce the
paper's MNIST results.


This implementation simplifies the model in the following ways:

 - LeNetConvPool doesn't implement location-specific gain and bias parameters
 - LeNetConvPool doesn't implement pooling by average, it implements pooling
   by max.
 - Digit classification is implemented with a logistic regression rather than
   an RBF network
 - LeNet5 was not fully-connected convolutions at second layer
